# pageXML specification

The PageXML specification for this version (v0.1) is detailed in `specification.md`. The specification is to be seen as a guideline, to which the appropriate polyfill is also suitably stored here, as `polyfill.js`.

The specifcation is best viewed on the website, where the syntax highlighting is evident.
