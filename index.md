**PageXML is the basis of an idea for how hypertext pages can be assembled without the use of custom scripts. This is mildly inspired by [WML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Markup_Language "Wireless Markup Language") card/deck functionality and the nature of the modern web. It carries no current implementation.**


PageXML is an in-development standard which is centered around allowing multi-page, easily-formatted documents to be produced, in a human-readable format. It draws upon similar XML/XHTML-centric standards, but holds the aim of being able to support a wider variety of devices. This format allows for several pages to be bundled together in a manner which can then act as if they are separate. Ebooks, virtual newspapers, and presentations are just some of the potential uses for this standard.

This website, alongside  the relevant specifications and libraries are stored in code form on [Github](http://github.com/isaacrg/pagexml).
